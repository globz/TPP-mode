TPP-mode
========

This is a quick and dirty script for TwitchPlaysPokemon : http://www.twitch.tv/twitchplayspokemon


Auto vote @ every 30 seconds for TPP game mode **works only with twitch IRC web client**

 * How to: 
 * copy paste the script into the console 
 * then type into the console TPP('democracy'); or TPP('anarchy'); 
 *
 * => Anarchy mode is the "classic" mode, where everyone's inputs are applied immediately.
 * => Democracy mode is vote-based and has a more sophisticated input system.
