TPP-mode
========

This is a quick and dirty script for TwitchPlaysPokemon : http://www.twitch.tv/twitchplayspokemon


>Auto vote @ every 30 seconds for TPP game mode **works only with twitch IRC web client**

>Keep track of your votes

How to: 
 * copy paste the script into your browser console 
 * click the vote button by selecting either anarchy/democracy mode



=>Anarchy mode is the "classic" mode, where everyone's inputs are applied immediately.

=>Democracy mode chooses the most popular input provided during a 20 second voting period.


In order to switch from one mode to the other a certain number of votes must be for the opposing mode.

To get from anarchy mode to democracy mode 80% of the votes must be for democracy mode.

To get from democracy mode to anarchy mode 50% of the votes must be for anarchy mode.

The reason for this asymmetry is that with the equal 75% it took a smaller majority to disrupt democracy mode then it did to reinstate anarchy mode.

In democracy mode you can compile a sequence of inputs. left2 will move left twice, left2down2 will move left twice and down twice.
